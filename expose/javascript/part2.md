Line 12 prints out 3 which is the length of our prices array. It is able to do this since we declared i as a var in our for loop, therefore we can still reference it even outside the for loop scope.

**2**
Line 13 prints out the discounted price of 150.  It is able to do so without error due to the scope being a var

**3**
Line 14 prints out the final price of 150.  It is able to do so without error due to the scope being a var

**4**
The function will return an array of all of the discounted prices

**5**
Line 12 will give an error since we are trying to call i outside of the for-loop scope

**6**
Line 13 will give an error since we are trying to call discountedPrice outside of the for-loop scope

**7**
Line 14 will correctly print the finalPrice of 150 since it is within the same scope in which it is declared

**8** 
The function will return the same thing as before with an array of the discounted prices

**9**
Line 11 will have the same error as before as the scope of i is limited to the for-loop

**10**
Line 12 will print the length of the initial prices array input which is 3 and it can do so since it is in the same scope as const

**11**

The function will return an array with each element in the original array being doubled. It does this by looping through each element and then calling the callback function which doubles the element and then pushes it into this new array which will be returned.
